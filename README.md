# 🧠 Daisy's Learning Lab

Solving problems. Building systems. Teaching through practice.

Welcome to my public learning journal —  
a structured record of problem solving, technical exploration, and knowledge building.  

Here, I don't just “solve problems”;  
I document **how I think**, **why a solution works**, and **how to explain it clearly**.  
Every note, every code snippet, and every reflection is part of my growth journey.

## 🚀 Purpose
This site exists to:

- Track my LeetCode problem-solving journey (and reduce procrastination)
- Analyze patterns behind algorithms
- Maintain multi-language implementations
- Organize system design & technical notes
- Archive structured YouTube / course insights
- Build a long-term technical knowledge base

It is not just a blog.  
It is a growing technical asset that reflects **learning in action**.

## 🧠 LeetCode Journal Structure

Each problem includes:

- 📌 Problem summary (rewritten in my own words, sometimes with AI assistance)
- 🪜 Step-by-step thinking process
- 💻 Multi-language solutions (mainly in C++)
- ⏱ Time & space complexity analysis (my attempt + AI suggestions)

Problems are organized by **patterns**, not by submission time:

/leetcode
    arrays
    two-pointers
    binary-search
    dynamic-programming
    graph
    backtracking


The goal: **recognize patterns, not just solutions.**

## 📚 Notes & Courses (Reserved Section)

Future expansion:
/notes
    system-design
    oauth
    database
    backend-architecture

This section will document:

- Technical deep dives
- System-level thinking
- Course materials
- Structured learning insights

---

## 🎥 YouTube Knowledge Archive

Video content will be paired with structured notes:

/youtube
    video-01-notes
    video-02-notes


Each entry connects:

- Explanation
- Code
- Reflection
- Improvement points

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack
Planned as a static knowledge system:

- GitHub Pages
- Markdown-based documentation
- Structured content organization
- Clean, minimal design

Focus: clarity > decoration.
---

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

This project is meant to become:
- A technical growth record
- A teaching resource
- A portfolio of thinking patterns
- A public knowledge system

Learning is not just about solving problems.
It is about understanding systems and being able to explain them clearly.

---
## 📌 Philosophy
Build.  
Reflect.  
Refine.  
Repeat.  

“The journey is the reward.”  
I may not be on the exact professional path yet,  
but every step, every problem solved, and every note taken  
is part of the growth that matters.

## 💡 How to Use This Site
- Browse the LeetCode journal to follow my problem-solving journey.  
- Explore the Notes & Courses section for structured learning insights.  
- Check out the YouTube Knowledge Archive to see lessons paired with reflections and code.  

Every page is meant to inspire, teach, and remind me — and maybe you too —  
that **learning is a journey, not a race**.
