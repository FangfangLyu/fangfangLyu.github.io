# Welcome to Daisy's Learning Lab

Hi! I'm **Daisy**, a lifelong learner, problem solver, and builder.  

I graduated recently, and while I’m not yet on my exact professional path,  
I’m actively building my skills through:

- **(STEP 1) LeetCode problem solving** — exploring algorithms and multi-language implementations  
- **（STEP 2) Technical notes & system design** — recording structured learning  
- ** (STEP 2 & 3) YouTube content & course insights** — reflecting and sharing knowledge  

This site is my **public learning journal**, where I document **how I think**,  
**why a solution works**, and **how to explain it clearly**.

## 📌 Philosophy

Build.  
Reflect.  
Refine.  
Repeat.  

**“The journey is the reward.”**  
I may not be on the exact professional path yet,  
but every step, every problem solved, and every note taken is part of the growth that truly matters.
